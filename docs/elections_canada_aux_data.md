- Copied from [Voter Turnout at Federal Elections and Referendums](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=ele&dir=turn&document=index&lang=e)
- Used corrected numbers as per footnotes
- Removed footnotes
- Added â€  marker for referendums, ignored footnote 3.
- For the GE45 I used the [Canada's population estimates, fourth quarter 2024](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/250319/dq250319a-eng.htm?HPA=1&indid=4098-1&indgeo=0) from Stats Can.
